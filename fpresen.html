				<section>My Final Project (by Jacob S.)</section>
				

				<section> Originally, my final project was going to be a presentation about a presentation. My favorite project of the year was my young soccer player ranking presentation, so I thought that I would use it for my final project.<a href="presen.html"> This is it. </a>However, that didn't seem like the best idea. so I decided to try and transfer my presentation into soccer player flashcards. I was messing up with importing the images into these flashcards so I realized that I should come up with something different. </section>

					This is what my flashcards looked like, clearly it wasn't going to work
				</section>
				<section> After brainstorming for a while I ended up just watching tiktok and was ready to just do one of the bummy projects I've made over the year, but I ended up seeing one about the Team of the Year for players in I think 1970? </section>
				<section> Then I realized I could make a project about young soccer players and more. I did so by making a hall of fame for each generation of players starting with the future hall of fame </section>
				<section> <a href="futurehof.html"> This is my generational hall of fame project. </a> </section>
