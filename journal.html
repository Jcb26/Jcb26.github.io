	<h3>Journal Entry #1</h3>

<p>Hi my name is Jacob. So far in comp sci I have been learning how to access parts of my computer through terminal and through coding. This includes parts of my desktop, folder, and even individual documents. Not only have I been learning how to access these things, but I have been learning how to change and modify them as I choose. For example, I could retitle a folder that says homework to classwork through terminal. More specifically, I have been learning about divs, memorizing patterns on how to call on variables, and much more. Can't wait to learn other new things.</p>

   <h3>Journal Entry #2</h3>

<p>Now I am able to turn what I have learned about using terminal and utilize that to develope my website. However, instead of using terminal, I am using sublime text to make my website, (which is what this entry is being written on). In terms of my website' features, I have learned how to add backround images and gifs to make my website look better. I can even make these images and gifs change to new things when I hover my cursor over them. As well as this, I can modify the height and width of the images to my liking. Hopefully my website looks good when this is being read. </p>

	<h3>Journal Entry #3</h3>

<p> This journal entry is about my square quilt project, which basically is just a function that makes a square, and repeats the process over and over again. First I added a little description for the projcect and created a header in the style section. Next, I customized the porpotions and color of the square by making a function. Lastly, I used an array to make the function that makes the square happen forty-eight times, which made forty-eight squares that we spread evenly throughout the quilt. That is how I coded my square quilt project.  </p>

   <h3>Journal Entry #4</h3>

<p> This journal entry is about my music codesketch, which just has music that plays when it is clicked. First it just makes a square. Then in the body, I just add an audio file and then make an event listener that has it play the music when you click. That is how I coded my music codesketch. </p>

   <h3>Journal Entry #5</h3>

<p> This journal entry is about my event listener project, in which when you move your mouse accross the screen the color of a square changes. I first make a div named tom in the style section, and afterwards get the div in the body section. Then I make an event listener that makes the square a different shade of a mix of red blue and green when the cursor is moved to different points on the screen. That is how I made my event listener project.</p>

	<h3>Journal Entry #6</h3>

<p> This journal entry is about my valentines day card project. First, I basically made three sections using divs in the body. These were one for the title of the project, a couple words to the reciever of the card, and an image of the heart. Then, I later on called the divs again and put the details of them in there, including the image adress for the heart that I had found. That is how I made my valentines day card project. </p>

	<h3> Journal Entry #7 </h3>
<p> This journal entry is the explanation behind the code on how to make a moving car image we learned in class. First you make a button that is the image of a car by putting in the dimensions and an image adress of your choice. Next, you leave the positioning of the car at the top left of the screen, and make an event listener that moves it forward when you press a button. The event listener makes it move 10 pixels from the original point. That is my explanation of the car project we learned in class. </p>

	<h3>Journal Entry #8</h3>

<p> This journal entry is about my flashcard project. I am just putting this here to say I am still working on it. </p>
