	<h3>Journal Entry #1</h3>

<p>Hi my name is Jacob. So far in comp sci I have been learning how to access parts of my computer through terminal and through coding. This includes parts of my desktop, folder, and even individual documents. Not only have I been learning how to access these things, but I have been learning how to change and modify them as I choose. For example, I could retitle a folder that says homework to classwork through terminal. More specifically, I have been learning about divs, memorizing patterns on how to call on variables, and much more. Can't wait to learn other new things.</p>

   <h3>Journal Entry #2</h3>

<p>Now I am able to turn what I have learned about using terminal and utilize that to develope my website. However, instead of using terminal, I am using sublime text to make my website, (which is what this entry is being written on). In terms of my website' features, I have learned how to add backround images and gifs to make my website look better. I can even make these images and gifs change to new things when I hover my cursor over them. As well as this, I can modify the height and width of the images to my liking. Hopefully my website looks good when this is being read.  </p>
