	<h3>Journal Entry #1</h3>

<p>Hi my name is Jacob. So far in comp sci I have been learning how to access parts of my computer through terminal and through coding. This includes parts of my desktop, folder, and even individual documents. Not only have I been learning how to access these things, but I have been learning how to change and modify them as I choose. For example, I could retitle a folder that says homework to classwork through terminal. More specifically, I have been learning about divs, memorizing patterns on how to call on variables, and much more. Can't wait to learn other new things.</p>

   <h3>Journal Entry #2</h3>

<p>Now I am able to turn what I have learned about using terminal and utilize that to develope my website. However, instead of using terminal, I am using sublime text to make my website, (which is what this entry is being written on). In terms of my website' features, I have learned how to add backround images and gifs to make my website look better. I can even make these images and gifs change to new things when I hover my cursor over them. As well as this, I can modify the height and width of the images to my liking. Hopefully my website looks good when this is being read. </p>

	<h3>Journal Entry #3</h3>

<p> This journal entry is about my square quilt project, which basically is just a function that makes a square, and repeats the process over and over again. First I added a little description for the projcect and created a header in the style section. Next, I customized the porpotions and color of the square by making a function. Lastly, I used an array to make the function that makes the square happen forty-eight times, which made forty-eight squares that we spread evenly throughout the quilt. That is how I coded my square quilt project.  </p>

   <h3>Journal Entry #4</h3>

<p> This journal entry is about my music codesketch, which just has music that plays when it is clicked. First it just makes a square. Then in the body, I just add an audio file and then make an event listener that has it play the music when you click. That is how I coded my music codesketch. </p>

   <h3>Journal Entry #5</h3>

<p> This journal entry is about my event listener project, in which when you move your mouse accross the screen the color of a square changes. I first make a div named tom in the style section, and afterwards get the div in the body section. Then I make an event listener that makes the square a different shade of a mix of red blue and green when the cursor is moved to different points on the screen. That is how I made my event listener project.</p>
