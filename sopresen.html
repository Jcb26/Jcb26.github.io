				<section>Top 5 Young Soccer Players in the World Right Now (Under 25)</section>
				<section data-background-image="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d765dbbe8dfd454da6d688c3e284aa6562b473/0_169_4076_2445/master/4076.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=4337eb1e19b6cc3c31598905539f1372" data-background-size="contain">

					<p style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);" class="fragment">(5)Jude Bellingham: Jude Bellingham has been absolutely tearing up the Bundesliga for the past 2 years and is unstoppable when on the ball. At 6,1 he is somehow able to dribble in very tight spaces and mantain perfect balance the entire time. As a center mid he isn't much of a goalscorer in the Bundesliga or during the World Cup, and at the moment he isn't on a very good team. Being one of the most sought after young players in the world though, he is most likely to move to a team where he can show his talent to the fullest.</p>

				<section>(4) Vinicius Jr: Vini is one of the fastest and tekkiest wingers let a lone players in the world right now. Last year alongside Karim Benzema he led his team Real Madrid to a Champions League and La Liga win, and he is looking to repeat it this year again. He has shown his talent especially through beating any defender whenever he wants. His pace combined with his dribbling is almost unstoppable, and he is at the moment he is a balon'dor contender. It is very likely he will win it or be in the top 3 for the award in the next couple of years.</section>
				<section> (3)Khvicha Kvaratskhelia: Also known as Kvaradona, Kvaratskhelia jumped on to the seen of world soccer this year with his transfer to Napoli in the Serie A. He is their star player, and alongside Victor Osimhen he is unstoppable. If you watch him play, you are almost gauranteed to see a defender get nutmegged or himuliated. In terms of pure driblling without pace I consider him the best in the world. The one thing holding him back is that he his national team is Georgia, so he will probably never make it to the world cup let alone win it. Simply a great player and future balon'dor contender.</section>
				<section>(2)Erling Haaland: Haaland is a robot. He only scores goals. He is the number one goalscorer in the world, the player with the most hattricks in the world, and he has scored five goals in a Champions League game. He is an unfair striker to have. People may argue that he only scores tapins, but if he does he does it a lot, to the point where it has to be skill. With all of the records he will break he is the ideal striker and is the most scary player in the world for centerbacks to play against. </section>
				<section> Honorable Mentions: Victor Osimhen, Raphael Leao, Jamal Musiala, Julian Alvarez, Pedri, Gavi, Ronald Araujo, and Bukayo Saka. </section>
				<section>(1)Kylian Mbappe: This is a no doubter. Mbappe is the best player in the world and will probably win the balon'dor this year. Even when double teamed he is impossible to defend. He alongside Haaland has scored 5 goals and has several hattricks, even as a winger. He consistently beats the fastest and best defenders in the world and because of that he is the best youngster and player in the world. </section>
